If you are a fan of classic aircraft and want to experience the most authentic DC-3 simulation ever, you might be interested in the MAAM-SIM Douglas R4D DC-3 C-47 package for FS2004 and FS2002. This package includes three different models of the legendary Douglas transport plane, each with its own flight dynamics, instruments, virtual cockpit and cabin. You can fly the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum's own R4D-6, a 28-passenger admiral's transport, a United Air Lines Mainliner "City of San Francisco", or a Buffalo Airways C-47 cargo plane.

But what if you have FSX and want to enjoy this amazing package in the latest version of Flight Simulator? Don't worry, MAAM-SIM has got you covered. They have released a free FSX Basic Compatibility Update that allows you to install and use the FS9 aircraft in FSX. This update fixes some of the vital issues in the configuration files and gauges, and adds thumbnail pictures for the FSX Select Aircraft Menu. You can download this update from the MAAM-SIM Free Stuff Page or from the file library.
 
However, installing and flying these aircraft in FSX is not as straightforward as in FS9. There are some compatibility issues that remain to be fixed, such as flight dynamics and some cosmetic glitches. Also, you need to follow some specific steps to make sure everything works properly. That's why we have prepared this guide to help you install and fly the MAAM-SIM Douglas R4D DC-3 C-47 in FSX with no stress and no cheats. Just follow these simple steps and you will be flying this classic bird in no time.
 
## Step 1: Get the MAAM-SIM Douglas R4D DC-3 C-47 CD
 
The first thing you need to do is to get the MAAM-SIM Douglas R4D DC-3 C-47 CD. You can only obtain this CD directly from the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum's On-Line Store or by mail or phone order from the museum. The price is $30 and it will be shipped via airmail anywhere in the world for $4.95. By purchasing this CD, you are also supporting the restoration programs of the museum, as 100% of the proceeds go directly to them.
 
The CD includes three aircraft models, each with its own documentation, checklists, reference cards, sound files, effects files, textures and liveries. It also includes some bonus features, such as a scenery of Reading Regional Airport / MAAM (KRDG), where the museum is located, a scenery of Buffalo Airways' base at Yellowknife (CYZF), where you can see their real C-47s in action, and a scenery of United Air Lines' historic hangar at Cheyenne (KCYS), where their Mainliner was restored.
 
## Step 2: Install the MAAM-SIM Douglas R4D DC-3 C-47 CD
 
Once you have received your CD, you need to install it on your computer. The installation process is very easy and straightforward. Just insert the CD into your drive and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to choose a destination folder for your files. We recommend that you install them in a temporary folder outside your FSX directory, such as C:\MAAM-SIM\R4D\_DC3\_C47\. This will make it easier to copy them later into your FSX folders.
 
The installation will create three subfolders inside your destination folder: R4D6\_50819 (for the museum's R4D), UAL\_DC3 (for the United Mainliner), and BUFF\_C47 (for the Buffalo Airways C-47). Each subfolder contains all the files needed for that aircraft model. You will also find some PDF files with documentation and manuals for each aircraft.
