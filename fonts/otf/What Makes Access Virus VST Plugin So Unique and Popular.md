If you are looking for a versatile and high-quality synthesizer plugin that can emulate the sound of hardware synths, you might want to check out the Access Virus TI. This plugin is based on the famous Virus line of synthesizers, which have been used by many artists and producers across different genres of music. The Access Virus TI plugin offers you the best of both worlds: the sound and performance of a hardware synth, and the convenience and integration of a software plugin.
 
The Access Virus TI plugin works as a VST or AU plugin for your DAW, or as a standalone application. You can also connect it to a Virus TI hardware synth via USB, and use it as an extension of your hardware. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of Total Integration, which allows you to control and edit your sounds from your computer, store your patches in your project files, and sync your hardware and software with sample-accurate timing.

The Access Virus TI plugin comes with over 3300 presets that cover a wide range of sounds, from classic analog to modern digital.

The plugin also has a stereo analog input that lets you process external signals through the Virus sound engine.
 
The Access Virus TI plugin is available in four different models: the TI Desktop, the TI Snow, the TI Keyboard, and the TI Polar. Each model has its own advantages and features, depending on your needs and preferences. Whether you are looking for a compact and portable synth, a full-sized keyboard with great action, or a stylish and ergonomic design, there is a Virus TI model for you.

One of the reasons why the Access Virus TI plugin is so popular and respected among synth enthusiasts is its sound quality and versatility. The plugin can emulate the classic analog sound of the original Virus models, as well as the modern digital sound of the latest Virus TI models. The plugin can also create unique and original sounds that go beyond the typical virtual analog synthesis, thanks to its advanced oscillator modes and effects.
 
For example, the plugin has a supersaw oscillator mode that can produce thick and lush sounds with up to nine detuned sawtooth waves per oscillator. The plugin also has a wavetable oscillator mode that can scan through different waveforms and create complex and evolving timbres. The plugin also has a granular oscillator mode that can chop up and rearrange samples in real time, creating glitchy and unpredictable sounds. The plugin also has a formant oscillator mode that can mimic the human voice and other vocal sounds.
 
The Access Virus TI plugin also has a powerful effects section that can enhance and transform your sounds even further. The plugin has 16 independent effect slots that can be assigned to any part of the synth. The plugin has a wide range of effects to choose from, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, bitcrusher, compressor, EQ, and more. The plugin also has a virus control center that lets you tweak and automate various parameters of the synth from your computer.
