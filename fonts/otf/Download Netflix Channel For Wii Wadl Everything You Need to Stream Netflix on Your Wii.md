# How to Download Netflix Channel for Wii Wadl
 
If you want to watch Netflix on your Wii console, you need to download the Netflix Channel from the Wii Shop Channel. The Netflix Channel allows you to stream movies and TV shows from Netflix's library with your regular subscription fee. However, the Netflix Channel is no longer available for download since January 30, 2019, and it does not work on either Dolphin emulator or Wii hardware[^1^]. Therefore, you need to find an alternative way to download the Netflix Channel for Wii Wadl.
 
One possible way is to use a WAD file, which is a package of files that can be installed on the Wii using a WAD manager. A WAD file contains the channel's data and metadata, such as its title, icon, banner, and sound. You can find a WAD file for the Netflix Channel on the Internet Archive[^2^], which is a website that preserves digital content. The WAD file is named netflix-v-2049-usa-hcle.wad and it was uploaded on December 11, 2020.

If that happens, you may want to consider other options for watching Netflix on your Wii, such as using a streaming device like Chromecast or Roku.
