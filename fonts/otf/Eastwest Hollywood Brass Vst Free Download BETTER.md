## Features and Benefits of the Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst
 
The Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst is a comprehensive and realistic brass library that offers you several advantages over other brass products. Here are some of the features and benefits that make it stand out:
 
- **High-quality samples:** The samples of the Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst are recorded in 24-bit resolution at 44.1 kHz sample rate, which ensures a clear and detailed sound. The samples are also recorded in EastWest's famous Studio 1, which is the birthplace of major Hollywood soundtracks and TV themes. The recording engineer, Shawn Murphy, is a Grammy and Academy Award winner who has worked with John Williams, James Horner, Danny Elfman, and many other top composers. He used state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to capture the best possible sound of the brass instruments.
- **Multiple mic positions:** The Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst gives you up to five mixable mic positions for each instrument, which allows you to adjust the balance and perspective of the sound to your liking. You can choose from the main Decca tree mic, which gives you a natural and spacious sound; the mid mic, which gives you a more focused and direct sound; the close mic, which gives you a dry and intimate sound; the surround mic, which gives you a wide and ambient sound; and the alternate vintage 1945 RCA ribbon room mic, which gives you a warm and retro sound. You can also use the built-in mixer to adjust the volume, pan, solo, mute, and output of each mic position.
- **Multiple articulations:** The Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst provides you with multiple articulations for each instrument, which lets you create nuanced and lifelike performances. You can choose from sustains, sustains with vibrato, sustains with non-vibrato, sustains lite, sustains marcato long, sustains marcato short, sustains accent, expressive vibrato, sustains with pitch waver, portatos, portatos short, portatos long, legato repetitions RRx4 (round robin), and mariachi sustains. You can also use keyswitches to switch between different articulations on the fly.
- **True legato:** The Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst features true legato samples for each instrument, which means that every transition between notes is sampled and played back smoothly and realistically. This creates a seamless and natural sounding legato performance that is hard to achieve with other brass libraries. You can also adjust the speed and volume of the legato transitions using the mod wheel or expression pedal.
- **Brass reverb impulses:** The Eastwest Hollywood Brass Vst includes brass reverb impulses taken from the renowned convolution reverb Quantum Leap Spaces. These are specially designed reverb presets that match the sound and character of the brass instruments. You can use them to add depth and realism to your mix without compromising the quality or clarity of the sound. You can also tweak the reverb parameters such as decay time, pre-delay, size, damping, width, wet/dry mix, etc.
