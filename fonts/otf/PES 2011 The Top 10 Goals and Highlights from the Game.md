FIFA 22 is the newest edition of the FIFA series, developed by EA Sports.

FIFA 22 also has a wide range of game modes, such as Career Mode, Volta Football, and Ultimate Team.
 
## Licenses and Teams
 
PES 11 has a disadvantage when it comes to licenses and teams, as it does not have the official rights to many of the top leagues and clubs in the world. For example, you will not find the Premier League, La Liga, or Bundesliga in PES 11, but rather generic names and logos. However, PES 11 does have some exclusive licenses, such as the UEFA Champions League, Copa Libertadores, and AFC Champions League.
 
FIFA 22 has an advantage when it comes to licenses and teams, as it has the official rights to almost all of the major leagues and clubs in the world. You will find the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, MLS, and more in FIFA 22, with authentic names and logos. FIFA 22 also has some exclusive licenses, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro, and CONMEBOL Copa America.
