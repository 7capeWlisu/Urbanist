What is tajwid and why is it important? Tajwid is the science of articulating the letters and words of the Quran according to the rules and principles that were taught by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions. Tajwid ensures that the Quran is recited in the way that Allah intended, without any distortion or alteration. Tajwid also enhances the beauty and eloquence of the Quranic recitation, making it more pleasing to the ears and hearts of the listeners.

Learning tajwid is an obligation for every Muslim who wants to recite the Quran properly and correctly. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever recites the Quran well and clearly, he is with the noble and righteous scribes (angels). And whoever recites the Quran with difficulty, stammering or stumbling through its verses, then he will have twice that reward." (Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim)
 
However, learning tajwid can be challenging for some people, especially those who are not familiar with the Arabic language or its pronunciation. That is why Buku Qiroati was created to simplify and facilitate the learning process of tajwid. Buku Qiroati uses a step-by-step approach that starts from the basic level of recognizing and pronouncing the Arabic letters, then gradually progresses to the advanced level of applying the rules and variations of tajwid. Buku Qiroati also provides exercises and examples to help the students practice and master their skills.
